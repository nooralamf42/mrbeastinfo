              <p className="mt-4">
                MysticArt Pictures, LLC (“we”, “MAP”, “us” or “our”) has a firm commitment to respect and protect the privacy of users of the MAP website (a “Site”). This MysticArt Pictures, LLC Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (this “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, share, and protect the personal information of users of our Site. By accessing, using, registering with, or providing personal information to the Site, you explicitly accept, without limitation or qualification, the collection, use, storage and transfer (including international transfer) in the manner described in this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time). <strong>THIS PRIVACY POLICY AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES UNDER THE LAW. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Site or provide us with personal information. Doing so will result in your audition being automatically rejected.</strong>
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                The Site provides a range of content hosting and communication services, and seeks to connect talent, models, dancers, voice talent, hosts, potential contestants and show participants, and other artists (collectively, “Talent”) with professionals rendering professional services in motion picture, theatrical, radio, television and other entertainment enterprises (collectively, “Industry Professional Entities” and “Industry Professionals”).
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 underline">Special notice to Talent</h3>
              <p className="mt-4">
                There are practical considerations relating to the need for Industry Professional Entities to review certain personal information, and to contact Talent for casting purposes. By registering and creating a profile on the Site you understand that you are affirmatively choosing to post personal information about yourself, including contact information such as your phone number and e-mail address, as well as physically identifying information such as your height, weight, hair, and eye color. You also have the option to post photographs, videos and other materials that may allow third parties to personally identify you. This information may be viewable outside of the Site via web search engines, which are outside of our control. By registering on the Site and submitting any such information, you acknowledge and agree that such personal information may be revealed to other Site users and the public, and that you are aware of the risks inherent in so doing.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 underline">Special note about minors</h3>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We are particularly concerned about the safety and privacy of all of our users, particularly individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under the age of 18, nor do we allow users under the age of 18 to directly establish their own profiles on the Site. All users under the age of 18 may only post profiles on the Site if they are represented by an adult agent or other authorized Industry Professional Entity, or by a parent or legal guardian who has registered on their behalf and who maintains the profile on their behalf (the “Registering Adult”). If we become aware that a profile has been established for an individual under the age of 18 without a Registering Adult, we will take steps to terminate such profile and remove any corresponding information.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Users under the age of 18 may monitor and modify their profile and personal information posted on the Site under the supervision of the Registering Adult.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 underline">Scope of this Privacy Policy</h3>
              <p className="mt-4">
                This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or any offline contact or communications external to the Site between MAP and any other company, you and MAP, or you and other registered users of the Site, or to information otherwise collected by third parties through social networking platforms.

Any revisions to our Privacy Policy will be posted here, as well as a notice in a prominent location on the Sites and, if we have a way and are legally permitted to do so, we will make an effort to contact you by email in the event this Privacy Policy is materially changed. You are required to agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy in order to maintain your Site profile. Any revised policy will supersede and replace previous privacy policies, effective as of the date on which it is posted.

              <p className="mt-2">
                The collection and use of your personal information may be necessary for us to provide you with positive and customized experience on the Site, to provide you with a product or service, to communicate with you, or maintain our relationship with you. We do not collect your personal information unless you or someone who is expressly authorized by you (or if you are under 18, the Registering Adult) chooses to provide it to us.
              </p>

                We may need to disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws, legal processes, and/or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Because MysticArt Pictures, LLC is a U.S. company and information collected on our Site is stored in whole or in part in the United States, your information may become subject to U.S. law. We may also disclose information when we believe, in our sole discretion, such disclosure is necessary or appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4">
                When you create or post a profile to the Site, that profile is stored in our searchable talent database in the United States. Once posted, your profile will be searchable, and all third parties with access to our searchable talent database (or copies thereof) will have access to your profile. Industry Professionals or other third parties with access to our searchable talent database may be located in countries whose data protection legislation may not be equivalent to the laws in your country. For example, your profile may be viewed and accessed by Industry Professionals outside the European Economic Area who have access to our searchable database. By making your profile searchable, you are expressly consenting to such transfers of your data.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                We attempt to limit access to our searchable talent database to legitimate users such as Industry Professional Entities and law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other third parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the use made of profiles by third parties who access such talent profiles while they are in our searchable database. You may make your profile inaccessible to such third parties from our talent database by cancelling your account at any time by following the instructions in “Cancelling your Account”.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 underline">California Resident Rights</h3>
              <p className="mt-4">
                A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to主 of whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its Privacy Policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost-free means to exercise that right.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                As stated in our Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your prior express consent to such disclosure. If you opt-in to allow us to share your information with a third party for its direct marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on our Site. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to such third party's Privacy Policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use your information. You should always review the Privacy Policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:casting@mysticartpictures.com" className="underline">casting@mysticartpictures.com</a>. Please note that we are only required by law to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
